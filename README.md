- 👋 Hi, I’m Khaled, and to introduce myself well I have my own business that is specialized in web development called Mugendai; it is not open to the world until now soon it will be live to the public but the perfect work needs some time to be done.
- 👀 I’m interested in web development front-end and in the future, I will be a Full-Stack Developer :)
